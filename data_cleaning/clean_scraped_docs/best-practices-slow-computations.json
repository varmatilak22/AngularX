In the performance timeline, click a bar to preview a particular change detection cycle. This displays a bar chart, which shows how long the framework spent in change detection for each component. When you click a component, you can preview how long Angular spent evaluating its template and lifecycle hooks.\n\n![Angular DevTools profiler preview showing slow computation](https://angular.dev/best-practices/assets/images/best-practices/runtime-performance/slow-computations.png)\n\nFor example, in the preceding screenshot, the second recorded change detection cycle is selected. Angular spent over 573 ms on this cycle, with the most time spent in the `EmployeeListComponent`. In the details panel, you can see that Angular spent over 297 ms evaluating the template of the `EmployeeListComponent`.\n\n## [Optimizing slow computations](https://angular.dev/best-practices/slow-computations\\#optimizing-slow-computations)\n\nHere are several techniques to remove slow computations:\n\n- **Optimizing the underlying algorithm**. This is the recommended approach. If you can speed up the algorithm that is causing the problem, you can speed up the entire change detection mechanism.\n- **Caching using pure pipes**. You can move the heavy computation to a pure [pipe](https://angular.dev/best-practices/guide/pipes). Angular reevaluates a pure pipe only if it detects that its inputs have changed, compared to the previous time Angular called it.\n- **Using memoization**. [Memoization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization) is a similar technique to pure pipes, with the difference that pure pipes preserve only the last result from the computation where memoization could store multiple results.\n- **Avoid repaints/reflows in lifecycle hooks**. Certain [operations](https://web.dev/avoid-large-complex-layouts-and-layout-thrashing/) cause the browser to either synchronously recalculate the layout of the page or re-render it. Since reflows and repaints are generally slow, you want to avoid performing them in every change detection cycle.\n\nPure pipes and memoization have different trade-offs. Pure pipes are an Angular built-in concept compared to memoization, which is a general software engineering practice for caching function results. The memory overhead of memoization could be significant if you invoke the heavy computation frequently with different arguments.",
