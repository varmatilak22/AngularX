If the component is declared in an NgModule (meaning that it is not standalone) make sure that it is exported correctly from it, by checking its presence in the `exports` field.\n\nWhen using custom elements or web components, ensure that you add [`CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA`](https://angular.dev/errors/api/core/CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA) to the application module.\n\nIf this does not resolve the error, check the imported libraries for any recent changes to the exports and properties you are using, and restart your server.",
