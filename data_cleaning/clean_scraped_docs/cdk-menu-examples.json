I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life\u2026 He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful\u2026 the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.\n\nGmail inline menu.\n\nlinkcodeopen\\_in\\_new\n\nInboxSnoozedImportantSentDraftsAll Mail\n\nGoogle Docs Menu Bar.\n\nlinkcodeopen\\_in\\_new\n\nFileEditFormat\n\nNested context menus.\n\nlinkcodeopen\\_in\\_new\n\nOuter context menu\n\nInner context menu\n\nMenu with Standalone Trigger.\n\nlinkcodeopen\\_in\\_new\n\nClick me!\n\nStateful Menu with Standalone Trigger.\n\nlinkcodeopen\\_in\\_new\n\nClick me!\n\nAzure & Blue theme selected.\n\nSelect a version of the documentation\n\nSelect a theme for the documentation\n\nEdit Context menu. example in StackBlitz\n\nCopy link to example\n\nView code\n\nEdit Gmail inline menu. example in StackBlitz\n\nEdit Google Docs Menu Bar. example in StackBlitz\n\nEdit Nested context menus. example in StackBlitz\n\nEdit Menu with Standalone Trigger. example in StackBlitz\n\nEdit Stateful Menu with Standalone Trigger. example in StackBlitz",
