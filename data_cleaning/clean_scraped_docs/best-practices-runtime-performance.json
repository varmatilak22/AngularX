To better understand the performance of your app we offer [Angular DevTools](https://angular.dev/tools/devtools) and a [video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjyX_hkscII) on how to use Chrome DevTools for profiling. In this section we cover the most common performance optimization techniques.\n\n**Change detection** is the process through which Angular checks to see whether your application state has changed, and if any DOM needs to be updated. At a high level, Angular walks your components from top to bottom, looking for changes. Angular runs its change detection mechanism periodically so that changes to the data model are reflected in an application\u2019s view. Change detection can be triggered either manually or through an asynchronous event (for example, a user interaction or an XMLHttpRequest completion).\n\nChange detection is highly optimized and performant, but it can still cause slowdowns if the application runs it too frequently.\n\nIn this guide, you\u2019ll learn how to control and optimize the change detection mechanism by skipping parts of your application and running change detection only when necessary.\n\nWatch this video if you prefer to learn more about performance optimizations in a media format:\n\n4 Runtime Performance Optimizations - YouTube\n\nAngular\n\n159K subscribers\n\n[4 Runtime Performance Optimizations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8sA-i6gkGQ)\n\nAngular\n\nSearch\n\nWatch later\n\nShare\n\nCopy link\n\nInfo\n\nShopping\n\nTap to unmute\n\nIf playback doesn't begin shortly, try restarting your device.\n\nShare\n\nInclude playlist\n\nAn error occurred while retrieving sharing information.
