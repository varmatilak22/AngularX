To increase transparency into how this daily work connects to the framework\u2019s future, our roadmap brings together the team\u2019s current and future planned vision.\n\nThe following projects are not associated with a particular Angular version. We will release them on completion, and they will be part of a specific version based on our release schedule, following semantic versioning. For example, we release features in the next minor after completion or the next major if they include breaking changes.\n\nCurrently, Angular has two goals for the framework:\n\n1. Improve the [Angular developer experience](https://angular.dev/roadmap#improving-the-angular-developer-experience) and\n2. Improve the [framework\u2019s performance](https://angular.dev/roadmap#fast-by-default).\n\nContinue reading to learn how we plan to deliver these objectives with specific project work.\n\n## [Explore modern Angular](https://angular.dev/roadmap\\#explore-modern-angular)\n\nStart developing with the latest Angular features from our roadmap. This list represents the current status of new features from our roadmap:\n\n### [Available to experiment with](https://angular.dev/roadmap\\#available-to-experiment-with)\n\n- [Incremental hydration](https://angular.dev/guide/incremental-hydration)\n- [Zoneless change detection](https://angular.dev/guide/experimental/zoneless)\n- [Hydration support for i18n blocks](https://angular.dev/api/platform-browser/withI18nSupport)\n- [Resource API](https://angular.dev/guide/signals/resource)\n- [Effect API](https://angular.dev/api/core/effect)\n- [Linked Signal API](https://angular.dev/guide/signals/linked-signal)\n- [Route-level render mode](https://angular.dev/guide/hybrid-rendering)\n\n### [Production ready](https://angular.dev/roadmap\\#production-ready)\n\n- [Explore Angular Signals](https://angular.dev/guide/signals)\n- [Event replay with SSR](https://angular.dev/api/platform-browser/withEventReplay)\n- [Deferrable views](https://angular.dev/guide/defer)\n- [Built-in control flow](https://angular.dev/guide/templates/control-flow)\n- [Local variable declaration](https://angular.dev/guide/templates/variables)\n- [Signal inputs](https://angular.dev/guide/signals/inputs)\n- [Model inputs](https://angular.dev/guide/signals/model)\n- [Signal queries](https://angular.dev/guide/signals/queries)\n- [Function-based outputs](https://angular.dev/guide/components/outputs)\n\n## [Improving the Angular developer experience](https://angular.dev/roadmap\\#improving-the-angular-developer-experience)\n\n### [Developer velocity](https://angular.dev/roadmap\\#developer-velocity)\n\n[**Deliver Angular Signals** \\\\\n\\\\\nThis project rethinks the Angular reactivity model by introducing Signals as a reactivity primitive. The initial planning resulted in hundreds of discussions, conversations with developers, feedback sessions, user experience studies, and a series of RFCs, which received over 1,000 comments.\\\\\n\\\\\nAs part of the v17 release, we graduated the Angular Signals library from developer preview. In v19 we moved signal-based queries, inputs, and model inputs to stable. Next, we'll need to finalize effects before we complete this project.\\\\\n\\\\\nLearn more](https://github.com/angular/angular/discussions/49685)\n\n### Zoneless Angular\n\nIn v18 we shipped experimental zoneless support in Angular. It enables developers to use the framework without including zone.js in their bundle, which improves performance, debugging experience, and interoperability. As part of the initial release we also introduced zoneless support to the Angular CDK and Angular Material.\n\nIn v19 we introduced zoneless support in server-side rendering, addressed some edge cases, and created a schematic to scaffold zoneless projects. We transitioned [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to zoneless which improved performance, developer experience, and allowed us to identify gaps that we need to address before moving this feature to developer preview. Stay tuned for more updates in the next months.\n\n### Signal integrations\n\nWe're working towards improving the integration of fundamental Angular packages, such as forms, HTTP, and router, with Signals. As part of this project, we'll seek opportunities to introduce convenient signal-based APIs or wrappers to improve the holistic developer experience.\n\n### Signal debugging in Angular DevTools\n\nWith the evolution of Signals in Angular, we are working on a better tooling for debugging them. High on the priority list is a UI for inspecting and debugging signals.\n\n[**Improve HMR (Hot Module Reload)** \\\\\n\\\\\nWe're working towards faster edit/refresh cycle by enabling hot module replacement.\\\\\n\\\\\nIn Angular v19 we shipped initial support for CSS and template HMR. We'll continue collecting feedback to make sure we're addressing developers' needs before we mark this project as complete.\\\\\n\\\\\nLearn more](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/39367#issuecomment-1439537306)\n\n### [Improve Angular Material and the CDK](https://angular.dev/roadmap\\#improve-angular-material-and-the-cdk)\n\n### New CDK primitives\n\nWe are working on new CDK primitives to facilitate creating custom components based on the WAI-ARIA design patterns for [Combobox](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#combobox). Angular v14 introduced stable [menu and dialog primitives](https://material.angular.io/cdk/categories) as part of this project, and in v15 Listbox.\n\n### Angular component accessibility\n\nWe are evaluating components in Angular Material against accessibility standards such as WCAG and working to fix any issues that arise from this process.\n\n### [Improve tooling](https://angular.dev/roadmap\\#improve-tooling)\n\n### Modernize unit testing tooling with ng test\n\nIn v12, we revisited the Angular end-to-end testing experience by replacing Protractor with modern alternatives such as Cypress, Nightwatch, Puppeteer, Playwright, and Webdriver.io. Next, we'd like to tackle `ng test` to modernize Angular's unit testing experience.\n\nWe're currently evaluating Web Test Runner, Vitest, and Jest as candidates for a new test runner for Angular projects while preserving Jasmine as assertion library to not break existing tests.\n\n[**Evaluating Nitro support in the Angular CLI** \\\\\n\\\\\nWe're excited about the set of features that Nitro offers such as more deployment options, improved compatibility of server-side rendering with different runtimes and file-based routing. In 2025 we'll evaluate how it fits in the Angular server-side rendering model.\\\\\n\\\\\nWe'll share updates as we make progress in this investigation.\\\\\n\\\\\nLearn more](https://nitro.unjs.io/)\n\n## [Fast by default](https://angular.dev/roadmap\\#fast-by-default)\n\n### Enable incremental hydration\n\nIn v17 we graduated hydration from developer preview and we've been consistently observing 40-50% improvements in LCP. Since then we started prototyping incremental hydration and shared a demo on stage at ng-conf.\n\nIn v19 we shipped the incremental hydration in developer preview mode, powered by `@defer` blocks. Give it a try and [share your feedback](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues) with us!\n\n### Server route configuration\n\nWe're working towards enabling a more ergonomic route configuration on the server. We want to make it trivial to declare which routes should be server-side rendered, prerendered or client-side rendered.\n\nIn Angular v19 we shipped developer preview of route-level render mode which allows you to granularly configure which routes you want Angular to prerender, server-side render or client-side render.\n\n## [Future work, explorations, and prototyping](https://angular.dev/roadmap\\#future-work-explorations-and-prototyping)\n\nThis section represents explorations and prototyping of potential future projects. A reasonable outcome is to decide that our current solutions are the best options. Other projects may result in RFCs, graduating to in-progress projects, or being deprioritized as the web continues to innovate along with our framework.\n\n### Signal Forms\n\nWe plan to analyze existing feedback about Angular forms and design a solution which addresses developers' requirements and uses Signals for management of reactive state.\n\n### Selectorless\n\nTo reduce boilerplate and improve the ergonomics of standalone components we are now designing a solution that will make selectors optional. To use a component or directive you'll be able to import it and directly use it in a component's template.\n\nWe're still in early stages of planning selectorless. We'll share a request for comments when we have an early design and we're ready for next steps.\n\n### Exploration of streamed server-side rendering\n\nOver the past few releases we've been working on making Angular's server-side rendering story more robust. On our priority list is to explore streamed server-side rendering for zoneless application.\n\n### Investigation for authoring format improvements\n\nBased on our developer surveys' results we saw there are opportunities for improving the ergonomics of the component authoring format. The first step of the process will be to gather requirements and understand the problem space in advanced to an RFC. We'll share updates as we make progress. High priority in the future work will be backward compatibility and interoperability.\n\n### Improve TestBed\n\nBased on feedback over the years and the recent updates in Angular's runtime, we'll evaluate TestBed to identify opportunities to improve developer experience and reduce boilerplate when developing unit tests.\n\n### Incremental adoption\n\nAngular has been lacking the tools and the flexibility to add interactivity to a multi-page app or embed an Angular component inside of an existing app built with a different framework.\n\nAs part of this project, we'll explore the requirement space of cross framework interop and our build tooling offering to make this use case possible.\n\n## [Completed projects](https://angular.dev/roadmap\\#completed-projects)\n\n[**Support two-dimensional drag-and-drop** \\\\\n\\\\\nAs part of this project, we implemented mixed orientation support for the Angular CDK drag and drop. This is one of the repository's most highly requested features.\\\\\n\\\\\nCompleted in Q2 2024](https://github.com/angular/components/issues/13372) [**Event replay with SSR and prerendering** \\\\\n\\\\\nIn v18 we introduced an event replay functionality when using server-side rendering or prerendering. For this feature we depend on the event dispatch primitive (previously known as jsaction) that is running on Google.com.\\\\\n\\\\\nIn Angular v19 we graduated event replay to stable and enabled it by default for all new projects.\\\\\n\\\\\nCompleted in Q4 2024](https://angular.dev/api/platform-browser/withEventReplay)\n\n### Integrate Angular Language Service with Schematics\n\nTo make it easier for developers to use modern Angular APIs, we enabled integration between the Angular language service and schematics which allows you to refactor your app with a single click.\n\nCompleted in Q4 2024\n\n### Streamline standalone imports with Language Service\n\nAs part of this initiative, the language service automatically imports components and pipes in standalone and NgModule-based apps. Additionally, we've added a template diagnostic to highlight unused imports in standalone components, which should help make application bundles smaller.\n\nCompleted in Q4 2024\n\n### Local template variables\n\nWe've released the support for local template variables in Angular, see [`@let` docs](https://angular.dev/api/core/@let) for additional information.\n\nCompleted in Q3 2024\n\n[**Expand the customizability of Angular Material** \\\\\n\\\\\nTo provide better customization of our Angular Material components and enable Material 3 capabilities, we'll be collaborating with Google's Material Design team on defining token-based theming APIs.\\\\\n\\\\\nIn v17.2 we shared experimental support for Angular Material 3 and in v18 we graduated it to stable.\\\\\n\\\\\nCompleted in Q2 2024](https://material.angular.io/guide/theming) [**Introduce deferred loading** \\\\\n\\\\\nIn v17 we shipped deferrable views in developer preview, which provide an ergonomic API for deferred code loading. In v18 we enabled deferrable views for library developers and graduated the API to stable.\\\\\n\\\\\nCompleted in Q2 2024](https://next.angular.dev/guide/defer)\n\n### iframe support in Angular DevTools\n\nWe enabled debugging and profiling of Angular apps embedded within an iframe on the page.\n\nCompleted in Q2 2024\n\n[**Automation for transition of existing hybrid rendering projects to esbuild and vite** \\\\\n\\\\\nIn v17 we shipped a vite and esbuild-based application builder and enabled it for new projects by default. It improves build time for projects using hybrid rendering with up to 87%. As part of v18 we shipped schematics and a guide that migrate existing projects using hybrid rendering to the new build pipeline.\\\\\n\\\\\nCompleted in Q2 2024](https://angular.dev/tools/cli/build-system-migration) [**Make Angular.dev the official home for Angular developers** \\\\\n\\\\\nAngular.dev is the new site, domain and home for Angular development. The new site contains updated documentation, tutorials and guidance that will help developers build with Angular\u2019s latest features.\\\\\n\\\\\nCompleted in Q2 2024](https://goo.gle/angular-dot-dev) [**Introduce built-in control flow** \\\\\n\\\\\nIn v17 we shipped a developer preview version of a new control flow. It brings significant performance improvements and better ergonomics for template authoring. We also provided a migration of existing `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, and `*ngSwitch` which you can run to move your project to the new implementation. As of v18 the built-in control flow is now stable.\\\\\n\\\\\nCompleted in Q2 2024](https://next.angular.dev/essentials/conditionals-and-loops)\n\n### Modernize getting started tutorial\n\nOver the past two quarters, we developed a new [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT0lHYhHMY&list=PL1w1q3fL4pmj9k1FrJ3Pe91EPub2_h4jF) and [textual](https://angular.dev/tutorials/learn-angular) tutorial based on standalone components.\n\nCompleted Q4 2023\n\n[**Investigate modern bundlers** \\\\\n\\\\\nIn Angular v16, we released a developer preview of an esbuild-based builder with support for `ng build` and `ng serve`. The `ng serve` development server uses Vite and a multi-file compilation by esbuild and the Angular compiler. In v17 we graduated the build tooling from developer preview and enabled it by default for new projects.\\\\\n\\\\\nCompleted Q4 2023](https://angular.dev/guide/hydration) [**Introduce dependency injection debugging APIs** \\\\\n\\\\\nTo improve the debugging utilities of Angular and Angular DevTools, we'll work on APIs that provide access to the dependency injection runtime. As part of the project, we'll expose debugging methods that allow us to explore the injector hierarchy and the dependencies across their associated providers. As of v17, we shipped a feature that enables us to plug into the dependency injection life-cycle. We also launched a visualization of the injector tree and inspection of the providers declared inside each individual node,\\\\\n\\\\\nCompleted Q4 2023](https://angular.dev/tools/devtools) [**Improve documentation and schematics for standalone components** \\\\\n\\\\\nWe released a developer preview of the `ng new --standalone` schematics collection, allowing you to create apps free of NgModules. In v17 we switched the new application authoring format to standalone APIs and changed the documentation to reflect the recommendation. Additionally, we shipped schematics which support updating existing applications to standalone components, directives, and pipes. Even though NgModules will stick around for foreseeable future, we recommend you to explore the benefits of the new APIs to improve developer experience and benefit from the new features we build for them.\\\\\n\\\\\nCompleted Q4 2023](https://angular.dev/components)\n\n### Explore hydration and server-side rendering improvements\n\nIn v16, we released a developer preview of non-destructive full hydration, see the [hydration guide](https://angular.dev/guide/hydration) and the [blog post](https://blog.angular.dev/whats-next-for-server-side-rendering-in-angular-2a6f27662b67) for additional information. We're already seeing significant improvements to Core Web Vitals, including [LCP](https://web.dev/lcp) and [CLS](https://web.dev/cls). In lab tests, we consistently observed 45% better LCP of a real-world app.\n\nIn v17 we launched hydration outside developer preview and did a series of improvements in the server-side rendering story, including: route discovery at runtime for SSG, up to 87% faster build times for hybrid rendered applications, prompt that enables hybrid rendering for new projects.\n\nCompleted Q4 2023\n\n[**Non-destructive full app hydration** \\\\\n\\\\\nIn v16, we released a developer preview of non-destructive full hydration, which allows Angular to reuse existing DOM nodes on a server-side rendered page, instead of re-creating an app from scratch. See additional information in the hydration guide.\\\\\n\\\\\nCompleted Q1 2023](https://angular.dev/guide/hydration) [**Improvements in the image directive** \\\\\n\\\\\nWe released the Angular image directive as stable in v15. We introduced a new fill mode feature that enables images to fit within their parent container rather than having explicit dimensions. Over the past two months, the Chrome Aurora team backported the directive to v12 and newer.\\\\\n\\\\\nCompleted Q1 2023](https://angular.dev/guide/image-optimization) [**Documentation refactoring** \\\\\n\\\\\nEnsure all existing documentation fits into a consistent set of content types. Update excessive use of tutorial-style documentation into independent topics. We want to ensure the content outside the main tutorials is self-sufficient without being tightly coupled to a series of guides. In Q2 2022, we refactored the template content and dependency injection. In Q1 2023, we improved the HTTP guides, and with this, we're putting the documentation refactoring project on hold.\\\\\n\\\\\nCompleted Q1 2023](https://angular.io/) [**Improve image performance** \\\\\n\\\\\nThe Aurora and the Angular teams are working on the implementation of an image directive that aims to improve Core Web Vitals. We shipped a stable version of the image directive in v15.\\\\\n\\\\\nCompleted Q4 2022](https://angular.dev/guide/image-optimization) [**Modern CSS** \\\\\n\\\\\nThe Web ecosystem evolves constantly and we want to reflect the latest modern standards in Angular. In this project we aim to provide guidelines on using modern CSS features in Angular to ensure developers follow best practices for layout, styling, etc. We shared official guidelines for layout and as part of the initiative stopped publishing flex layout.\\\\\n\\\\\nCompleted Q4 2022](https://blog.angular.dev/modern-css-in-angular-layouts-4a259dca9127) [**Support adding directives to host elements** \\\\\n\\\\\nA long-standing feature request is to add the ability to add directives to host elements. The feature lets developers augment their own components with additional behaviors without using inheritance. In v15 we shipped our directive composition API, which enables enhancing host elements with directives.\\\\\n\\\\\nCompleted Q4 2022](https://angular.dev/guide/directives/directive-composition-api) [**Better stack traces** \\\\\n\\\\\nThe Angular and the Chrome DevTools are working together to enable more readable stack traces for error messages. In v15 we released improved relevant and linked stack traces. As a lower priority initiative, we'll be exploring how to make the stack traces friendlier by providing more accurate call frame names for templates.\\\\\n\\\\\nCompleted Q4 2022](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/devtools-better-angular-debugging/) [**Enhanced Angular Material components by integrating MDC Web** \\\\\n\\\\\nMDC Web is a library created by the Google Material Design team that provides reusable primitives for building Material Design components. The Angular team is incorporating these primitives into Angular Material. Using MDC Web aligns Angular Material more closely with the Material Design specification, expands accessibility, improves component quality, and improves the velocity of our team.\\\\\n\\\\\nCompleted Q4 2022](https://material.angular.io/guide/mdc-migration) [**Implement APIs for optional NgModules** \\\\\n\\\\\nIn the process of making Angular simpler, we are working on introducing APIs that allow developers to initialize apps, instantiate components, and use the router without NgModules. Angular v14 introduces developer preview of the APIs for standalone components, directives, and pipes. In the next few quarters we'll collect feedback from developers and finalize the project making the APIs stable. As the next step we will work on improving use cases such as TestBed, Angular elements, etc.\\\\\n\\\\\nCompleted Q4 2022](https://blog.angular.dev/angular-v15-is-now-available-df7be7f2f4c8) [**Allow binding to protected fields in templates** \\\\\n\\\\\nTo improve the encapsulation of Angular components we enabled binding to protected members of the component instance. This way you'll no longer have to expose a field or a method as public to use it inside your templates.\\\\\n\\\\\nCompleted Q2 2022](https://angular.dev/guide/templates/binding) [**Publish guides on advanced concepts** \\\\\n\\\\\nDevelop and publish an in-depth guide on change detection.
