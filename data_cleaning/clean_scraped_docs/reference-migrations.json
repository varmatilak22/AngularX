Standalone components specify their dependencies directly instead of getting them through NgModules.\\\\\n\\\\\nMigrate now](https://angular.dev/reference/reference/migrations/standalone) [**Control Flow Syntax** \\\\\n\\\\\nBuilt-in Control Flow Syntax allows you to use more ergonomic syntax which is close to JavaScript and has better type checking. It replaces the need to import `CommonModule` to use functionality like `*ngFor`, `*ngIf` and `*ngSwitch`.\\\\\n\\\\\nMigrate now](https://angular.dev/reference/reference/migrations/control-flow) [**inject() Function** \\\\\n\\\\\nAngular's `inject` function offers more accurate types and better compatibility with standard decorators, compared to constructor-based injection.\\\\\n\\\\\nMigrate now](https://angular.dev/reference/reference/migrations/inject-function) [**Lazy-loaded routes** \\\\\n\\\\\nConvert eagerly loaded component routes to lazy loaded ones. This allows the build process to split production bundles into smaller chunks, to load less JavaScript at initial page load.\\\\\n\\\\\nMigrate now](https://angular.dev/reference/reference/migrations/route-lazy-loading) [**New \\`input()\\` API** \\\\\n\\\\\nConvert existing `@Input` fields to the new signal input API that is now production ready.\\\\\n\\\\\nMigrate now](https://angular.dev/reference/reference/migrations/signal-inputs) [**New \\`output()\\` function** \\\\\n\\\\\nConvert existing `@Output` custom events to the new output function that is now production ready.\\\\\n\\\\\nMigrate now](https://angular.dev/reference/reference/migrations/outputs) [**Queries as signal** \\\\\n\\\\\nConvert existing decorator query fields to the improved signal queries API. The API is now production ready.\\\\\n\\\\\nMigrate now](https://angular.dev/reference/reference/migrations/signal-queries) [**Cleanup unused imports** \\\\\n\\\\\nClean up unused imports in your project.\\\\\n\\\\\nTry it now](https://angular.dev/reference/reference/migrations/cleanup-unused-imports) [**Self-closing tags** \\\\\n\\\\\nConvert component templates to use self-closing tags where possible.\\\\\n\\\\\nMigrate now](https://angular.dev/reference/reference/migrations/self-closing-tags)",
