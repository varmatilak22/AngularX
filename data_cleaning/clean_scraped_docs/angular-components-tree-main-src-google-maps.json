API](https://github.com/angular/components/commit/9f1989228f10694b61e694db456c387687e9626d \"feat(google-maps): add support for dynamic library loading API  Currently the `@angular/google-maps` module is implemented on top of the legacy `<script>` API which is problematic, because: 1. It loads all of the JavaScript up-front, even if there are no maps on the page. 2. It requires the user to ensure that the API is fully loaded before the `<google-map>` component starts rendering. Lazy-loading in this scenario is error-prone and loading the API up-front leads to a lot of unused JavaScript being loaded.  These changes add support for the [Dynamic Library Import API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/load-maps-js-api#dynamic-library-import) which requires a tiny script to be added up-front which then allows the `<google-map>` to load the chunks of the API it needs on-demand. The legacy API is still supported, but is no longer recommended.  All the components also now have `initialized` outputs to make it easier to know when the underlying Maps classes have been created and can be interacted with.\") | Dec 28, 2023 |\n| [google-maps-module.ts](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/main/src/google-maps/google-maps-module.ts \"google-maps-module.ts\") | [google-maps-module.ts](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/main/src/google-maps/google-maps-module.ts \"google-maps-module.ts\") | [feat(google-maps): implement new marker clusterer](https://github.com/angular/components/commit/c70aae15b095f5d7005b491270866f6647732a26 \"feat(google-maps): implement new marker clusterer  Adds a new `MapMarkerClusterer` component that is based on the most up-to-date clustering library, and supports both regular and advanced markers.

This is necessary when using the npm package of CDK in the Material schematic tests.  To do this we need to give up on our non-statically readable substitutions for tslib and RxJS but this is acceptable as those don't change often and the benefits of the pnpm workspace are more important.  We move `parse5` from `optionalDependencies` to `dependencies` so that pnpm recognizes this as non-dev dependency for the runtime execution of the CDK package. `parse5` doesn't have any native code, so `optionalDependencies` vs `dependencies` doesn't make a difference.

For example, the Google Maps component could have its options set either\nin with a google.maps.MapOptions object:\n\n```\n<google-map [options]=\"options\" />\n```\n\n```\noptions: google.maps.MapOptions = {\n  center: {lat: 40, lng: -20},\n  zoom: 4\n};\n```\n\nIt can also have individual options set for some of the most common options:\n\n```\n<google-map [center]=\"center\" [zoom]=\"zoom\" />\n```\n\n```\ncenter: google.maps.LatLngLiteral = {lat: 40, lng: -20};\nzoom = 4;\n```\n\nNot every option has its own input. See the API for each component to see if the option has a\ndedicated input or if it should be set in the options input.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.",
