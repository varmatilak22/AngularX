}  error(msg: unknown) { console.error(msg); }  warn(msg: unknown) { console.warn(msg); }}\n\n```\n\ncheck\n\nServices can depend on other services.\nFor example, here's a `HeroService` that depends on the `Logger` service, and also uses `BackendService` to get heroes.\nThat service in turn might depend on the `HttpClient` service to fetch heroes asynchronously from a server:\n\n### src/app/hero.service.ts\n\n```\n      import { inject } from \"@angular/core\";export class HeroService {  private heroes: Hero[] = [];  private backend = inject(BackendService);  private logger = inject(Logger);  async getHeroes() {    // Fetch    this.heroes = await this.backend.getAll(Hero);    // Log    this.logger.log(`Fetched ${this.heroes.length} heroes.`);    return this.heroes;  }}\n\n```\n\ncheck\n\n## [Creating an injectable service](https://angular.dev/guide/di/creating-injectable-service\\#creating-an-injectable-service)\n\nThe Angular CLI provides a command to create a new service. In the following example, you add a new service to an existing application.\n\nTo generate a new `HeroService` class in the `src/app/heroes` folder, follow these steps:\n\n1. Run this [Angular CLI](https://angular.dev/tools/cli) command:\n\n```\n      ng generate service heroes/hero\n\n```\n\ncheck\n\nThis command creates the following default `HeroService`:\n\n### src/app/heroes/hero.service.ts (CLI-generated)\n\n```\n      import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';@Injectable({  providedIn: 'root',})export class HeroService {}\n\n```\n\ncheck\n\nThe `@Injectable()` decorator specifies that Angular can use this class in the DI system.\nThe metadata, `providedIn: 'root'`, means that the `HeroService` is provided throughout the application.\n\nAdd a `getHeroes()` method that returns the heroes from `mock.heroes.ts` to get the hero mock data:\n\n### src/app/heroes/hero.service.ts\n\n```\n      import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';import { HEROES } from './mock-heroes';@Injectable({  // declares that this service should be created  // by the root application injector.  providedIn: 'root',})export class HeroService {  getHeroes() {    return HEROES;  }}\n\n```\n\ncheck\n\nFor clarity and maintainability, it is recommended that you define components and services in separate files.\n\n## [Injecting services](https://angular.dev/guide/di/creating-injectable-service\\#injecting-services)\n\nTo inject a service as a dependency into a component, you can declare a class field representing the dependency and use Angular's `inject` function to initialize it.\n\nThe following example specifies the `HeroService` in the `HeroListComponent`.\nThe type of `heroService` is `HeroService`.\n\n### src/app/heroes/hero-list.component.ts\n\n```\n      import { inject } from \"@angular/core\";export class HeroListComponent {  private heroService = inject(HeroService);}\n\n```\n\ncheck\n\nIt is also possible to inject a service into a component using the component's constructor:\n\n### src/app/heroes/hero-list.component.ts (constructor signature)\n\n```\n      constructor(private heroService: HeroService)\n\n```\n\ncheck\n\nThe `inject` method can be used in both classes and functions, while the constructor method can naturally only be used in a class constructor. However, in either case a dependency may only be injected in a valid [injection context](https://angular.dev/guide/di/guide/di/dependency-injection-context), usually in the construction or initialization of a component.\n\n## [Injecting services in other services](https://angular.dev/guide/di/creating-injectable-service\\#injecting-services-in-other-services)\n\nWhen a service depends on another service, follow the same pattern as injecting into a component.\nIn the following example, `HeroService` depends on a `Logger` service to report its activities:\n\n### src/app/heroes/hero.service.ts\n\n```\n      import { inject, Injectable } from '@angular/core';import { HEROES } from './mock-heroes';import { Logger } from '../logger.service';@Injectable({  providedIn: 'root',})export class HeroService {  private logger = inject(Logger);  getHeroes() {    this.logger.log('Getting heroes.');    return HEROES;  }}\n\n```\n\ncheck\n\nIn this example, the `getHeroes()` method uses the `Logger` service by logging a message when fetching heroes.\n\n## [What's next](https://angular.dev/guide/di/creating-injectable-service\\#whats-next)",
