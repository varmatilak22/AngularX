While certain parts of the page should be shown to the user immediately, there may be portions that can wait to display until later.\nAngular's _deferrable views_, using the `@defer` syntax, can help you speed up your application by telling Angular to wait to download the JavaScript for the parts of the page that don't need to be shown right away.\n\nIn this activity, you'll learn how to use deferrable views to defer load a section of your component template.\n\n* * *\n\n1. ### [Add a `@defer` block to a section of a template](https://angular.dev/tutorials/deferrable-views/1-what-are-deferrable-views\\#add-a-defer-block-to-a-section-of-a-template)\n\n\nIn your `app.component.ts`, wrap the `article-comments` component with a `@defer` block to defer load it.\n\n\n\n```\n         @defer {  <article-comments />}\n\n```\n\ncheck\n\nBy default, `@defer` loads the `article-comments` component when the browser is idle.\n\nIn your browser's developer console, you can see that the `article-comments-component` lazy chunk file is loaded separately (The specific file names may change from run to run):\n\n\n\n```\n         Initial chunk files | Names                      |  Raw sizechunk-NNSQHFIE.js   | -                          | 769.00 kB | main.js             | main                       | 229.25 kB | Lazy chunk files    | Names                      |  Raw sizechunk-T5UYXUSI.js   | article-comments-component |   1.84 kB |\n\n```\n\ncheck\n\n\nGreat work!
