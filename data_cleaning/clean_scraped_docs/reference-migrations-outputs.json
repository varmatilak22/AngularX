This API mimics the `input()` API but is not based on Signals.\nRead more about custom events output function and its benefits in the [dedicated guide](https://angular.dev/reference/migrations/guide/components/outputs).\n\nTo support existing projects that would like to use output function, the Angular team\nprovides an automated migration that converts `@Output` custom events to the new `output()` API.\n\nRun the schematic using the following command:\n\n```\n      ng generate @angular/core:output-migration\n\n```\n\ncheck\n\n## [What does the migration change?](https://angular.dev/reference/migrations/outputs\\#what-does-the-migration-change)\n\n1. `@Output()` class members are updated to their `output()` equivalent.\n2. Imports in the file of components or directives, at Typescript module level, are updated as well.\n3. Migrates the APIs functions like `event.next()`, which use is not recommended, to `event.emit()` and removes `event.complete()` calls.\n\n**Before**\n\n```\n      import {Component, Output, EventEmitter} from '@angular/core';@Component({  template: `<button (click)=\"someMethod('test')\">emit</button>`})export class MyComponent {  @Output() someChange = new EventEmitter<string>();  someMethod(value: string): void {    this.someChange.emit(value);  }}\n\n```\n\ncheck\n\n**After**\n\n```\n      import {Component, output} from '@angular/core';@Component({  template: `<button (click)=\"someMethod('test')\">emit</button>`})export class MyComponent {  readonly someChange = output<string>();  someMethod(value: string): void {    this.someChange.emit(value);  }}\n\n```\n\ncheck\n\n## [Configuration options](https://angular.dev/reference/migrations/outputs\\#configuration-options)\n\nThe migration supports a few options for fine tuning the migration to your specific needs.\n\n### [`--path`](https://angular.dev/reference/migrations/outputs\\#--path)\n\nIf not specified, the migration will ask you for a path and update your whole Angular CLI workspace.\nYou can limit the migration to a specific sub-directory using this option.\n\n### [`--analysis-dir`](https://angular.dev/reference/migrations/outputs\\#--analysis-dir)\n\nIn large projects you may use this option to reduce the amount of files being analyzed.\nBy default, the migration analyzes the whole workspace, regardless of the `--path` option, in\norder to update all references affected by an `@Output()` migration.\n\nWith this option, you can limit analysis to a sub-folder. Note that this means that any\nreferences outside this directory are silently skipped, potentially breaking your build.\n\nUse these options as shown below:\n\n```\n      ng generate @angular/core:output-migration --path src/app/sub-folder\n\n```\n\ncheck\n\n## [Exceptions](https://angular.dev/reference/migrations/outputs\\#exceptions)\n\nIn some cases, the migration will not touch the code.\nOne of these exceptions is the case where the event is used with a `pipe()` method.\nThe following code won't be migrated:\n\n```\n      export class MyDialogComponent {  @Output() close = new EventEmitter<void>();  doSome(): void {    this.close.complete();  }  otherThing(): void {    this.close.pipe();  }}\n\n```\n\ncheck",
