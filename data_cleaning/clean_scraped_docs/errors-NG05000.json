This is not yet a fully supported configuration.\n\nIf you use a custom Zone.js implementation, make sure that the \"onStable\" event is emitted at the right time and does not result in incorrect application behavior with hydration.\n\nMore information about hydration can be found in the [hydration guide](https://angular.dev/errors/guide/hydration).",
