Consider dependency injection to be the ability for Angular to _provide_ resources you need for your application at runtime. A dependency could be a service or some other resources.\n\nNote: Learn more about [dependency injection in the essentials guide](https://angular.dev/essentials/dependency-injection).\n\nIn this activity, you'll learn how to create an `injectable` service.\n\n* * *\n\nOne way to use a service is to act as a way to interact with data and APIs. To make a service reusable you should keep the logic in the service and share it throughout the application when it is needed.\n\nTo make a service eligible to be injected by the DI system use the `@Injectable` decorator. For example:\n\n```\n      @Injectable({    providedIn: 'root'})class UserService {    // methods to retrieve and return data}\n\n```\n\ncheck\n\nThe `@Injectable` decorator notifies the DI system that the `UserService` is available to be requested in a class. `providedIn` sets the scope in which this resource is available. For now, it is good enough to understand that `providedIn: 'root'` means that the `UserService` is available to the entire application.\n\nAlright, you try:\n\n1. ### [Add the `@Injectable` decorator](https://angular.dev/tutorials/learn-angular/19-creating-an-injectable-service\\#add-the-injectable-decorator)\n\n\nUpdate the code in `car.service.ts` by adding the `@Injectable` decorator.\n\n2. ### [Configure the decorator](https://angular.dev/tutorials/learn-angular/19-creating-an-injectable-service\\#configure-the-decorator)\n\n\nThe values in the object passed to the decorator are considered to be the configuration for the decorator.\n\n\n\nUpdate the `@Injectable` decorator in `car.service.ts` to include the configuration for `providedIn: 'root'`.\n\nTIP: Use the above example to find the correct syntax.\n\n\nWell, done \ud83d\udc4d that service is now `injectable` and can participate in the fun. Now that the service is `injectable`, let's try injecting it into a component \ud83d\udc49\n\napp/car.service.ts editdelete\n\napp/app.component.ts\n\nadd\n\nlaunchdownload\n\n99\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n\u203a\n\n\u2304\n\n\u2304\n\n\u2304\n\nimport{Injectable}from'@angular/core';\n\nexportclassCarService{\n\ncars=\\['Sunflower GT','Flexus Sport','Sprout Mach One'\\];\n\ngetCars():string\\[\\]{\n\nreturnthis.cars;\n\n}\n\ngetCar(id:number){\n\nreturnthis.cars\\[id\\];\n\n}\n\n}\n\nPreview\n\nBooting\n\nConsole\n\nTerminal\n\nrefresh\n\nStackBlitz[iframe](cid:frame-0B37CC2478D3667E8533644DEDCF94F8@mhtml.blink)",
