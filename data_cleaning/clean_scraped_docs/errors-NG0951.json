Most notably, query results are _never_ available in a constructor of the component or directive declaring a query.\n\n## [Fixing the error](https://angular.dev/errors/NG0951\\#fixing-the-error)\n\n`contentChild` query results can be accessed in the `AfterContentChecked` lifecycle hook, or later.\n`viewChild` query results can be accessed in the `AfterViewChecked` lifecycle hook, or later.\n\nMake sure that a required query matches at least one node and has results at all. You can verify this by accessing query results in the lifecycle hooks listed above.",
