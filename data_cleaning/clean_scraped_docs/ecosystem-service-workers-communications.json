It may be used to notify the user of an available update or prompt them to refresh the page. |\n| `VersionInstallationFailedEvent` | Emitted when the installation of a new version failed. It may be used for logging/monitoring purposes. |\n\ncheck\n\n```\n      import {inject, Injectable} from '@angular/core';import {SwUpdate, VersionReadyEvent} from '@angular/service-worker';@Injectable({providedIn: 'root'})export class LogUpdateService {  private updates = inject(SwUpdate);  constructor() {    this.updates.versionUpdates.subscribe((evt) => {      switch (evt.type) {        case 'VERSION_DETECTED':          console.log(`Downloading new app version: ${evt.version.hash}`);          break;        case 'VERSION_READY':          console.log(`Current app version: ${evt.currentVersion.hash}`);          console.log(`New app version ready for use: ${evt.latestVersion.hash}`);          break;        case 'VERSION_INSTALLATION_FAILED':          console.log(`Failed to install app version '${evt.version.hash}': ${evt.error}`);          break;      }    });  }}\n\n```\n\n### [Checking for updates](https://angular.dev/ecosystem/service-workers/communications\\#checking-for-updates)\n\nIt's possible to ask the service worker to check if any updates have been deployed to the server.\nThe service worker checks for updates during initialization and on each navigation request \u2014that is, when the user navigates from a different address to your application.\nHowever, you might choose to manually check for updates if you have a site that changes frequently or want updates to happen on a schedule.\n\nDo this with the `checkForUpdate()` method:\n\n### check-for-update.service.ts\n\n```\n      import {ApplicationRef, inject, Injectable} from '@angular/core';import {SwUpdate} from '@angular/service-worker';import {concat, interval} from 'rxjs';import {first} from 'rxjs/operators';@Injectable({providedIn: 'root'})export class CheckForUpdateService {  private appRef = inject(ApplicationRef);  private updates = inject(SwUpdate);  constructor() {    // Allow the app to stabilize first, before starting    // polling for updates with `interval()`.    const appIsStable$ = this.appRef.isStable.pipe(first((isStable) => isStable === true));    const everySixHours$ = interval(6 * 60 * 60 * 1000);    const everySixHoursOnceAppIsStable$ = concat(appIsStable$, everySixHours$);    everySixHoursOnceAppIsStable$.subscribe(async () => {      try {        const updateFound = await this.updates.checkForUpdate();        console.log(updateFound ? 'A new version is available.' : 'Already on the latest version.');      } catch (err) {        console.error('Failed to check for updates:', err);      }    });  }}\n\n```\n\ncheck\n\nThis method returns a `Promise<boolean>` which indicates if an update is available for activation.\nThe check might fail, which will cause a rejection of the `Promise`.\n\n### Stabilization and service worker registration\n\nIn order to avoid negatively affecting the initial rendering of the page, by default the Angular service worker service waits for up to 30 seconds for the application to stabilize before registering the ServiceWorker script.\n\nConstantly polling for updates, for example, with [setInterval()](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setInterval) or RxJS' [interval()](https://rxjs.dev/api/index/function/interval), prevents the application from stabilizing and the ServiceWorker script is not registered with the browser until the 30 seconds upper limit is reached.\n\nThis is true for any kind of polling done by your application.\nCheck the [isStable](https://angular.dev/ecosystem/service-workers/api/core/ApplicationRef#isStable) documentation for more information.\n\nAvoid that delay by waiting for the application to stabilize first, before starting to poll for updates, as shown in the preceding example.\nAlternatively, you might want to define a different [registration strategy](https://angular.dev/ecosystem/service-workers/api/service-worker/SwRegistrationOptions#registrationStrategy) for the ServiceWorker.\n\n### [Updating to the latest version](https://angular.dev/ecosystem/service-workers/communications\\#updating-to-the-latest-version)\n\nYou can update an existing tab to the latest version by reloading the page as soon as a new version is ready.\nTo avoid disrupting the user's progress, it is generally a good idea to prompt the user and let them confirm that it is OK to reload the page and update to the latest version:\n\ncheck\n\n```\n      import {inject, Injectable} from '@angular/core';import {filter, map} from 'rxjs/operators';import {SwUpdate, VersionReadyEvent} from '@angular/service-worker';function promptUser(event: VersionReadyEvent): boolean {  return true;}@Injectable({providedIn: 'root'})export class PromptUpdateService {  constructor() {    const swUpdate = inject(SwUpdate);    swUpdate.versionUpdates      .pipe(filter((evt): evt is VersionReadyEvent => evt.type === 'VERSION_READY'))      .subscribe((evt) => {        if (promptUser(evt)) {          // Reload the page to update to the latest version.          document.location.reload();        }      });    // ...    const updatesAvailable = swUpdate.versionUpdates.pipe(      filter((evt): evt is VersionReadyEvent => evt.type === 'VERSION_READY'),      map((evt) => ({        type: 'UPDATE_AVAILABLE',        current: evt.currentVersion,        available: evt.latestVersion,      })),    );\n...  }}\n\n```\n\n### Safety of updating without reloading\n\nCalling `activateUpdate()` updates a tab to the latest version without reloading the page, but this could break the application.\n\nUpdating without reloading can create a version mismatch between the application shell and other page resources, such as lazy-loaded chunks, whose filenames may change between versions.\n\nYou should only use `activateUpdate()`, if you are certain it is safe for your specific use case.\n\n### [Handling an unrecoverable state](https://angular.dev/ecosystem/service-workers/communications\\#handling-an-unrecoverable-state)\n\nIn some cases, the version of the application used by the service worker to serve a client might be in a broken state that cannot be recovered from without a full page reload.\n\nFor example, imagine the following scenario:\n\n1. A user opens the application for the first time and the service worker caches the latest version of the application.\n    Assume the application's cached assets include `index.html`, `main.<main-hash-1>.js` and `lazy-chunk.<lazy-hash-1>.js`.\n\n2. The user closes the application and does not open it for a while.\n\n3. After some time, a new version of the application is deployed to the server.\n    This newer version includes the files `index.html`, `main.<main-hash-2>.js` and `lazy-chunk.<lazy-hash-2>.js`.\n\n\n**IMPORTANT:** The hashes are different now, because the content of the files changed. The old version is no longer available on the server.\n\n1. In the meantime, the user's browser decides to evict `lazy-chunk.<lazy-hash-1>.js` from its cache.\n    Browsers might decide to evict specific (or all) resources from a cache in order to reclaim disk space.\n\n2. The user opens the application again.\n    The service worker serves the latest version known to it at this point, namely the old version ( `index.html` and `main.<main-hash-1>.js`).\n\n3. At some later point, the application requests the lazy bundle, `lazy-chunk.<lazy-hash-1>.js`.\n\n4. The service worker is unable to find the asset in the cache (remember that the browser evicted it).\n    Nor is it able to retrieve it from the server (because the server now only has `lazy-chunk.<lazy-hash-2>.js` from the newer version).\n\n\nIn the preceding scenario, the service worker is not able to serve an asset that would normally be cached.\nThat particular application version is broken and there is no way to fix the state of the client without reloading the page.\nIn such cases, the service worker notifies the client by sending an `UnrecoverableStateEvent` event.\nSubscribe to `SwUpdate#unrecoverable` to be notified and handle these errors.\n\ncheck\n\n```\n      import {inject, Injectable} from '@angular/core';import {SwUpdate} from '@angular/service-worker';function notifyUser(message: string): void {}@Injectable({providedIn: 'root'})export class HandleUnrecoverableStateService {  private updates = inject(SwUpdate);  constructor() {    this.updates.unrecoverable.subscribe((event) => {      notifyUser(        'An error occurred that we cannot recover from:\n' +          event.reason +          '\n\nPlease reload the page.',      );    });  }}\n\n```\n\n## [More on Angular service workers](https://angular.dev/ecosystem/service-workers/communications\\#more-on-angular-service-workers)\n\nYou might also be interested in the following:",
