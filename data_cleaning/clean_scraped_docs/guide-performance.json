These guides are here to help you follow best practices for building performant applications by taking advantage of different rendering strategies.\n\n| Guides Types | Description |\n| :-- | :-- |\n| [Server-side rendering](https://angular.dev/guide/ssr) | Learn how to leverage rendering pages on the server to improve load times. |\n| [Build-time prerendering](https://angular.dev/guide/prerendering) | Also known as static-site generation (SSG), is an alternate rendering method to improve load times. |\n| [Hydration](https://angular.dev/guide/hydration) | A process to improve application performance by restoring its state after server-side rendering and reusing existing DOM structure as much as possible. |",
