Now go ahead and implement this along with the `UserComponent` in the playground.\n\nUse `'user'` for the path of `UserComponent`.\n\n2. ### [Add title to route definition](https://angular.dev/tutorials/learn-angular/13-define-a-route\\#add-title-to-route-definition)\n\n\nIn addition to defining the routes correctly, Angular Router also enables you to set the page title whenever users are navigating by adding the `title` property to each route.\n\nIn `app.routes.ts`, add the `title` property to the default route ( `path: ''`) and the `user` route. Here's an example:\n\n\n\n```\n         import {Routes} from '@angular/router';import {HomeComponent} from './home/home.component';export const routes: Routes = [{path: '',title: 'App Home Page',component: HomeComponent,},];\n\n```\n\ncheck\n\n\nIn the activity, you've learned how to define and configure routes in your Angular app. Nice work. \ud83d\ude4c\n\nThe journey to fully enabling routing in your app is almost complete, keep going.\n\napp/app.routes.ts editdelete\n\napp/home/home.component.ts\n\nadd\n\nlaunchdownload\n\n9\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n\u203a\n\nimport{Routes}from'@angular/router';\n\nimport{HomeComponent}from'./home/home.component';\n\nimport{UserComponent}from'./user/user.component';\n\nexportconstroutes:Routes=\\[\\];\n\nPreview\n\nBooting\n\nConsole\n\nTerminal\n\nrefresh",
