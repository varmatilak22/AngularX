Create a `typings.d.ts` file in your `src/` directory.\n    This file is automatically included as global type definition.\n\n2. Add the following code in `src/typings.d.ts`:\n\n\n\n```\n         declare module 'host' {   export interface Host {     protocol?: string;     hostname?: string;     pathname?: string;   }   export function parse(url: string, queryString?: string): Host; }\n\n```\n\ncheck\n\n3. In the component or file that uses the library, add the following code:\n\n\n\n```\n         import * as host from 'host'; const parsedUrl = host.parse('https://angular.io'); console.log(parsedUrl.hostname);\n\n```\n\ncheck\n\n\nDefine more typings as needed.\n\n## [Updating libraries](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/using-libraries\\#updating-libraries)\n\nA library is able to be updated by the publisher, and also has individual dependencies which need to be kept current.\nTo check for updates to your installed libraries, use the [`ng update`](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/cli/update \"ng\") Angular CLI command.\n\nUse `ng update <lib_name>` Angular CLI command to update individual library versions.\nThe Angular CLI checks the latest published release of the library, and if the latest version is newer than your installed version, downloads it and updates your `package.json` to match the latest version.\n\nWhen you update Angular to a new version, you need to make sure that any libraries you are using are current.\nIf libraries have interdependencies, you might have to update them in a particular order.\nSee the [Angular Update Guide](https://angular.dev/update-guide \"Angular\") for help.\n\n## [Adding a library to the runtime global scope](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/using-libraries\\#adding-a-library-to-the-runtime-global-scope)\n\nIf a legacy JavaScript library is not imported into an application, you may add it to the runtime global scope and load it as if it was added in a script tag.\nConfigure the Angular CLI to do this at build time using the `scripts` and `styles` options of the build target in the [`angular.json`](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/reference/configs/workspace-config \"Angular\") workspace build configuration file.\n\nFor example, to use the [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction \"Introduction\") library\n\n1. Install the library and the associated dependencies using the npm package manager:\n\n\n\n```\n         npm install jquery --save npm install popper.js --save npm install bootstrap --save\n\n```\n\ncheck\n\n2. In the `angular.json` configuration file, add the associated script files to the `scripts` array:\n\n\n\n```\n         \"scripts\": [   \"node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.slim.js\",   \"node_modules/popper.js/dist/umd/popper.js\",   \"node_modules/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.js\" ],\n\n```\n\ncheck\n\n3. Add the `bootstrap.css` CSS file to the `styles` array:\n\n\n\n```\n         \"styles\": [   \"node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css\",   \"src/styles.css\" ],\n\n```\n\ncheck\n\n4. Run or restart the `ng serve` Angular CLI command to see Bootstrap 4 work in your application.\n\n\n### [Using runtime-global libraries inside your app](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/using-libraries\\#using-runtime-global-libraries-inside-your-app)\n\nAfter you import a library using the \"scripts\" array, do **not** import it using an import statement in your TypeScript code.\nThe following code snippet is an example import statement.\n\n```\n      import * as $ from 'jquery';\n\n```\n\ncheck\n\nIf you import it using import statements, you have two different copies of the library: one imported as a global library, and one imported as a module.\nThis is especially bad for libraries with plugins, like JQuery, because each copy includes different plugins.\n\nInstead, run the `npm install @types/jquery` Angular CLI command to download typings for your library and then follow the library installation steps.\nThis gives you access to the global variables exposed by that library.\n\n### [Defining typings for runtime-global libraries](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/using-libraries\\#defining-typings-for-runtime-global-libraries)\n\nIf the global library you need to use does not have global typings, you can declare them manually as `any` in `src/typings.d.ts`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\n      declare var libraryName: any;\n\n```\n\ncheck\n\nSome scripts extend other libraries; for instance with JQuery plugins:\n\n```\n      $('.test').myPlugin();\n\n```\n\ncheck\n\nIn this case, the installed `@types/jquery` does not include `myPlugin`, so you need to add an interface in `src/typings.d.ts`.\nFor example:\n\n```\n      interface JQuery {  myPlugin(options?: any): any;}\n\n```\n\ncheck\n\nIf you do not add the interface for the script-defined extension, your IDE shows an error:\n\n```\n      [TS][Error] Property 'myPlugin' does not exist on type 'JQuery'\n\n```\n\ncheck",
