In general, pipes are \"pure\" functions that don't cause side effects. Angular has a number of helpful built-in pipes you can import and use in your components. You can also create a custom pipe.\n\nNote: Learn more about [pipes in the in-depth guide](https://angular.dev/guide/templates/pipes).\n\nIn this activity, you will import a pipe and use it in the template.\n\n* * *\n\nTo use a pipe in a template include it in an interpolated expression. Check out this example:\n\n```\n      import {UpperCasePipe} from '@angular/common';@Component({...template: `{{ loudMessage | uppercase }}`,imports: [UpperCasePipe],})class AppComponent {loudMessage = 'we think you are doing great!'}\n\n```\n\nNow, it's your turn to give this a try:\n\n1. ### [Import the `LowerCase` pipe](https://angular.dev/tutorials/learn-angular/22-pipes\\#import-the-lowercase-pipe)\n\n\nFirst, update `app.component.ts` by adding the file level import for `LowerCasePipe` from `@angular/common`.\n\n\n\n```\n         import { LowerCasePipe } from '@angular/common';\n\n```\n\n2. ### [Add the pipe to the template imports](https://angular.dev/tutorials/learn-angular/22-pipes\\#add-the-pipe-to-the-template-imports)\n\n\nNext, update `@Component()` decorator `imports` to include a reference to `LowerCasePipe`\n\n\n\n```\n         @Component({    ...    imports: [LowerCasePipe]})\n\n```\n\n3. ### [Add the pipe to the template](https://angular.dev/tutorials/learn-angular/22-pipes\\#add-the-pipe-to-the-template)\n\n\nFinally, in `app.component.ts` update the template to include the `lowercase` pipe:\n\n\n\n```\n         template: `{{username | lowercase }}`\n\n```\n\n\nPipes can also accept parameters which can be used to configure their output.
