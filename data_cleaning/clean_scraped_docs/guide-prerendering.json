The key distinction lies in its approach that pages are served as static content, and there is no request-based rendering.\n\nWhen the data necessary for server-side rendering remains consistent across all users, the strategy of prerendering emerges as a valuable alternative. Rather than dynamically rendering pages for each user request, prerendering takes a proactive approach by rendering them in advance.\n\n## [How to prerender a page](https://angular.dev/guide/prerendering\\#how-to-prerender-a-page)\n\nTo prerender a static page, add SSR capabilities to your application with the following Angular CLI command:\n\n```\n      ng add @angular/ssr\n\n```\n\ncheck\n\nTo create an application with prerendering capabilities from the beginning use the [`ng new --ssr`](https://angular.dev/guide/tools/cli/setup-local) command.\n\nOnce SSR is added, you can generate the static pages by running the build command:\n\n```\n      ng build\n\n```\n\ncheck\n\n### [Build options for prerender](https://angular.dev/guide/prerendering\\#build-options-for-prerender)\n\nThe application builder `prerender` option can be either a Boolean or an Object for more fine-tuned configuration.\nWhen the option is `false`, no prerendering is done. When it is `true`, all options use the default value. When it is an Object, each option can be individually configured.\n\n| Options | Details | Default Value |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| `discoverRoutes` | Whether the builder should process the Angular Router configuration to find all unparameterized routes and prerender them. | `true` |\n| `routesFile` | The path to a file that contains a list of all routes to prerender, separated by newlines. This option is useful if you want to prerender routes with parameterized URLs. |  |\n\n```\n      {  \"projects\": {    \"my-app\": {      \"architect\": {        \"build\": {          \"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:application\",          \"options\": {            \"prerender\": {              \"discoverRoutes\": false            }          }        }      }    }  }}\n\n```\n\ncheck\n\n### [Prerendering parameterized routes](https://angular.dev/guide/prerendering\\#prerendering-parameterized-routes)\n\nYou can prerender parameterized routes using the `routesFile` option. An example of a parameterized route is `product/:id`, where `id` is dynamically provided. To specify these routes, they should be listed in a text file, with each route on a separate line.\n\nFor an app with a large number of parameterized routes, consider generating this file using a script before running `ng build`.\n\n### routes.txt\n\n```\n      /products/1/products/555\n\n```\n\ncheck\n\nWith routes specified in the `routes.txt` file, use the `routesFile` option to configure the builder to prerender the product routes.\n\n```\n      {  \"projects\": {    \"my-app\": {      \"architect\": {        \"build\": {          \"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:application\",          \"options\": {            \"prerender\": {              \"routesFile\": \"routes.txt\"            }          }        }      }    }  }}\n\n```\n\ncheck\n\nThis configures `ng build` to prerender `/products/1` and `/products/555` at build time.",
