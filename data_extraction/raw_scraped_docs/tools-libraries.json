To add Angular features to non-Angular web applications, use [Angular custom elements](https://angular.dev/tools/guide/elements).\n\n## [Creating libraries](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries\\#creating-libraries)\n\nIf you have developed features that are suitable for reuse, you can create your own libraries.\nThese libraries can be used locally in your workspace, or you can publish them as [npm packages](https://angular.dev/tools/reference/configs/npm-packages) to share with other projects or other Angular developers.\nThese packages can be published to the npm registry, a private npm Enterprise registry, or a private package management system that supports npm packages.\nSee [Creating Libraries](https://angular.dev/tools/tools/libraries/creating-libraries).\n\nDeciding to package features as a library is an architectural decision. It is comparable to deciding whether a feature is a component or a service, or deciding on the scope of a component.\n\nPackaging features as a library forces the artifacts in the library to be decoupled from the application's business logic.\nThis can help to avoid various bad practices or architecture mistakes that can make it difficult to decouple and reuse code in the future.\n\nPutting code into a separate library is more complex than simply putting everything in one application.\nIt requires more of an investment in time and thought for managing, maintaining, and updating the library.\nThis complexity can pay off when the library is being used in multiple applications.",
