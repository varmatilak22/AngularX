This file contains the \"exports\" mapping used by runtimes and tools to perform module resolution. |\n| `index.d.ts` | Bundled `.d.ts` for the primary entrypoint `@angular/core`. |\n| `fesm2022/`<br> Â Â â”€ `core.mjs`<br> Â Â â”€ `core.mjs.map`<br> Â Â â”€ `testing.mjs`<br> Â Â â”€ `testing.mjs.map` | Code for all entrypoints in flattened (FESM) ES2022 format, along with source maps. |\n| `testing/` | Directory representing the \"testing\" entrypoint. |\n| `testing/index.d.ts` | Bundled `.d.ts` for the `@angular/core/testing` entrypoint. |\n\n## [`package.json`](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/angular-package-format\\#packagejson)\n\nThe primary `package.json` contains important package metadata, including the following:\n\n- It [declares](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/angular-package-format#esm-declaration) the package to be in EcmaScript Module (ESM) format\n\n- It contains an [`\"exports\"` field](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/angular-package-format#exports) which defines the available source code formats of all entrypoints\n\n- It contains [keys](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/angular-package-format#legacy-resolution-keys) which define the available source code formats of the primary `@angular/core` entrypoint, for tools which do not understand `\"exports\"`.\nThese keys are considered deprecated, and could be removed as the support for `\"exports\"` rolls out across the ecosystem.\n\n- It declares whether the package contains [side effects](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/angular-package-format#side-effects)\n\n\n### [ESM declaration](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/angular-package-format\\#esm-declaration)\n\nThe top-level `package.json` contains the key:\n\n```\n      {  \"type\": \"module\"}\n\n```\n\ncheck\n\nThis informs resolvers that code within the package is using EcmaScript Modules as opposed to CommonJS modules.\n\n### [`\"exports\"`](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/angular-package-format\\#quotexportsquot)\n\nThe `\"exports\"` field has the following structure:\n\n```\n      \"exports\": {  \"./schematics/*\": {    \"default\": \"./schematics/*.js\"  },  \"./package.json\": {    \"default\": \"./package.json\"  },  \".\": {    \"types\": \"./core.d.ts\",    \"default\": \"./fesm2022/core.mjs\"  },  \"./testing\": {    \"types\": \"./testing/testing.d.ts\",    \"default\": \"./fesm2022/testing.mjs\"  }}\n\n```\n\ncheck\n\nOf primary interest are the `\".\"` and the `\"./testing\"` keys, which define the available code formats for the `@angular/core` primary entrypoint and the `@angular/core/testing` secondary entrypoint, respectively.\nFor each entrypoint, the available formats are:\n\n| Formats | Details |\n| :-- | :-- |\n| Typings ( `.d.ts` files) | `.d.ts` files are used by TypeScript when depending on a given package. |\n| `default` | ES2022 code flattened into a single source. |\n\nTooling that is aware of these keys may preferentially select a desirable code format from `\"exports\"`.\n\nLibraries may want to expose additional static files which are not captured by the exports of the JavaScript-based entry-points such as Sass mixins or pre-compiled CSS.\n\nFor more information, see [Managing assets in a library](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/tools/libraries/creating-libraries#managing-assets-in-a-library).\n\n### [Legacy resolution keys](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/angular-package-format\\#legacy-resolution-keys)\n\nIn addition to `\"exports\"`, the top-level `package.json` also defines legacy module resolution keys for resolvers that don't support `\"exports\"`.\nFor `@angular/core` these are:\n\n```\n      {  \"module\": \"./fesm2022/core.mjs\",  \"typings\": \"./core.d.ts\",}\n\n```\n\ncheck\n\nAs shown in the preceding code snippet, a module resolver can use these keys to load a specific code format.\n\n### [Side effects](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/angular-package-format\\#side-effects)\n\nThe last function of `package.json` is to declare whether the package has [side effects](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/angular-package-format#sideeffects-flag).\n\n```\n      {  \"sideEffects\": false}\n\n```\n\ncheck\n\nMost Angular packages should not depend on top-level side effects, and thus should include this declaration.\n\n## [Entrypoints and code splitting](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/angular-package-format\\#entrypoints-and-code-splitting)\n\nPackages in the Angular Package Format contain one primary entrypoint and zero or more secondary entrypoints (for example, `@angular/common/http`).\nEntrypoints serve several functions.\n\n1. They define the module specifiers from which users import code (for example, `@angular/core` and `@angular/core/testing`).\n\n    Users typically perceive these entrypoints as distinct groups of symbols, with different purposes or capability.\n\n    Specific entrypoints might only be used for special purposes, such as testing.\n    Such APIs can be separated out from the primary entrypoint to reduce the chance of them being used accidentally or incorrectly.\n\n2. They define the granularity at which code can be lazily loaded.\n\n    Many modern build tools are only capable of \"code splitting\" (aka lazy loading) at the ES Module level.\n    The Angular Package Format uses primarily a single \"flat\" ES Module per entry point. This means that most build tooling is not able to split code with a single entry point into multiple output chunks.\n\n\nThe general rule for APF packages is to use entrypoints for the smallest sets of logically connected code possible.\nFor example, the Angular Material package publishes each logical component or set of components as a separate entrypoint - one for Button, one for Tabs, etc.\nThis allows each Material component to be lazily loaded separately, if desired.\n\nNot all libraries require such granularity.\nMost libraries with a single logical purpose should be published as a single entrypoint.\n`@angular/core` for example uses a single entrypoint for the runtime, because the Angular runtime is generally used as a single entity.\n\n### [Resolution of secondary entry points](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/angular-package-format\\#resolution-of-secondary-entry-points)\n\nSecondary entrypoints can be resolved via the `\"exports\"` field of the `package.json` for the package.\n\n## [README.md](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/angular-package-format\\#readmemd)\n\nThe README file in the Markdown format that is used to display description of a package on npm and GitHub.\n\nExample README content of @angular/core package:\n\n```\n      Angular=======The sources for this package are in the main [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular) repo.Please file issues and pull requests against that repo.License: MIT\n\n```\n\ncheck\n\n## [Partial compilation](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/angular-package-format\\#partial-compilation)\n\nLibraries in the Angular Package Format must be published in \"partial compilation\" mode.\nThis is a compilation mode for `ngc` which produces compiled Angular code that is not tied to a specific Angular runtime version, in contrast to the full compilation used for applications, where the Angular compiler and runtime versions must match exactly.\n\nTo partially compile Angular code, use the `compilationMode` flag in the `angularCompilerOptions` property of your `tsconfig.json`:\n\n```\n      {  â€¦  \"angularCompilerOptions\": {    \"compilationMode\": \"partial\",  }}\n\n```\n\ncheck\n\nPartially compiled library code is then converted to fully compiled code during the application build process by the Angular CLI.\n\nIf your build pipeline does not use the Angular CLI then refer to the [Consuming partial ivy code outside the Angular CLI](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/tools/libraries/creating-libraries#consuming-partial-ivy-code-outside-the-angular-cli) guide.\n\n## [Optimizations](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/angular-package-format\\#optimizations)\n\n### [Flattening of ES modules](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/angular-package-format\\#flattening-of-es-modules)\n\nThe Angular Package Format specifies that code be published in \"flattened\" ES module format.\nThis significantly reduces the build time of Angular applications as well as download and parse time of the final application bundle.\nPlease check out the excellent post [\"The cost of small modules\"](https://nolanlawson.com/2016/08/15/the-cost-of-small-modules) by Nolan Lawson.\n\nThe Angular compiler can generate index ES module files. Tools like Rollup can use these files to generate flattened modules in a _Flattened ES Module_ (FESM) file format.\n\nFESM is a file format created by flattening all ES Modules accessible from an entrypoint into a single ES Module.\nIt's formed by following all imports from a package and copying that code into a single file while preserving all public ES exports and removing all private imports.\n\nThe abbreviated name, FESM, pronounced _phe-som_, can be followed by a number such as FESM2020.\nThe number refers to the language level of the JavaScript inside the module.\nAccordingly a FESM2022 file would be ESM+ES2022 and include import/export statements and ES2022 source code.\n\nTo generate a flattened ES Module index file, use the following configuration options in your tsconfig.json file:\n\n```\n      {  \"compilerOptions\": {    â€¦    \"module\": \"esnext\",    \"target\": \"es2022\",    â€¦  },  \"angularCompilerOptions\": {    â€¦    \"flatModuleOutFile\": \"my-ui-lib.js\",    \"flatModuleId\": \"my-ui-lib\"  }}\n\n```\n\ncheck\n\nOnce the index file (for example, `my-ui-lib.js`) is generated by ngc, bundlers and optimizers like Rollup can be used to produce the flattened ESM file.\n\n### [\"sideEffects\" flag](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/angular-package-format\\#sideeffects-flag)\n\nBy default, EcmaScript Modules are side-effectful: importing from a module ensures that any code at the top level of that module should run.\nThis is often undesirable, as most side-effectful code in typical modules is not truly side-effectful, but instead only affects specific symbols.\nIf those symbols are not imported and used, it's often desirable to remove them in an optimization process known as tree-shaking, and the side-effectful code can prevent this.\n\nBuild tools such as webpack support a flag which allows packages to declare that they do not depend on side-effectful code at the top level of their modules, giving the tools more freedom to tree-shake code from the package.\nThe end result of these optimizations should be smaller bundle size and better code distribution in bundle chunks after code-splitting.\nThis optimization can break your code if it contains non-local side-effects - this is however not common in Angular applications and it's usually a sign of bad design.\nThe recommendation is for all packages to claim the side-effect free status by setting the `sideEffects` property to `false`, and that developers follow the [Angular Style Guide](https://angular.dev/style-guide) which naturally results in code without non-local side-effects.\n\nMore info: [webpack docs on side effects](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/tree/master/examples/side-effects)\n\n### [ES2022 language level](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/angular-package-format\\#es2022-language-level)\n\nES2022 Language level is now the default language level that is consumed by Angular CLI and other tooling.\nThe Angular CLI down-levels the bundle to a language level that is supported by all targeted browsers at application build time.\n\n### [d.ts bundling / type definition flattening](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/angular-package-format\\#dts-bundling---type-definition-flattening)\n\nAs of APF v8, it is recommended to bundle TypeScript definitions.\nBundling of type definitions can significantly speed up compilations for users, especially if there are many individual `.ts` source files in your library.\n\nAngular uses [`rollup-plugin-dts`](https://github.com/Swatinem/rollup-plugin-dts) to flatten `.d.ts` files (using `rollup`, similar to how FESM files are created).\n\nUsing rollup for `.d.ts` bundling is beneficial as it supports code splitting between entry-points.\nFor example, consider you have multiple entrypoints relying on the same shared type, a shared `.d.ts` file would be created along with the larger flattened `.d.ts` files.\nThis is desirable and avoids duplication of types.\n\n### [Tslib](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/angular-package-format\\#tslib)\n\nAs of APF v10, it is recommended to add tslib as a direct dependency of your primary entry-point.\nThis is because the tslib version is tied to the TypeScript version used to compile your library.\n\n## [Examples](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/angular-package-format\\#examples)\n\n## [Definition of terms](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/angular-package-format\\#definition-of-terms)\n\nThe following terms are used throughout this document intentionally.\nIn this section are the definitions of all of them to provide additional clarity.\n\n### [Package](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/angular-package-format\\#package)\n\nThe smallest set of files that are published to NPM and installed together, for example `@angular/core`.\nThis package includes a manifest called package.json, compiled source code, typescript definition files, source maps, metadata, etc.\nThe package is installed with `npm install @angular/core`.\n\n### [Symbol](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/angular-package-format\\#symbol)\n\nA class, function, constant, or variable contained in a module and optionally made visible to the external world via a module export.\n\n### [Module](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/angular-package-format\\#module)\n\nShort for ECMAScript Modules.\nA file containing statements that import and export symbols.\nThis is identical to the definition of modules in the ECMAScript spec.\n\n### [ESM](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/angular-package-format\\#esm)\n\nShort for ECMAScript Modules (see above).\n\n### [FESM](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/angular-package-format\\#fesm)\n\nShort for Flattened ES Modules and consists of a file format created by flattening all ES Modules accessible from an entry point into a single ES Module.\n\n### [Module ID](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/angular-package-format\\#module-id)\n\nThe identifier of a module used in the import statements (for example, `@angular/core`).\nThe ID often maps directly to a path on the filesystem, but this is not always the case due to various module resolution strategies.\n\n### [Module specifier](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/angular-package-format\\#module-specifier)\n\nA module identifier (see above).\n\n### [Module resolution strategy](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/angular-package-format\\#module-resolution-strategy)\n\nAlgorithm used to convert Module IDs to paths on the filesystem.\nNode.js has one that is well specified and widely used, TypeScript supports several module resolution strategies, [Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler) has yet another strategy.\n\n### [Module format](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/angular-package-format\\#module-format)\n\nSpecification of the module syntax that covers at minimum the syntax for the importing and exporting from a file.\nCommon module formats are CommonJS (CJS, typically used for Node.js applications) or ECMAScript Modules (ESM).\nThe module format indicates only the packaging of the individual modules, but not the JavaScript language features used to make up the module content.\nBecause of this, the Angular team often uses the language level specifier as a suffix to the module format, (for example, ESM+ES2022 specifies that the module is in ESM format and contains ES2022 code).\n\n### [Bundle](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/angular-package-format\\#bundle)\n\nAn artifact in the form of a single JS file, produced by a build tool (for example, [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) or [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/)) that contains symbols originating in one or more modules.\nBundles are a browser-specific workaround that reduce network strain that would be caused if browsers were to start downloading hundreds if not tens of thousands of files.\nNode.js typically doesn't use bundles.\nCommon bundle formats are UMD and System.register.\n\n### [Language level](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/angular-package-format\\#language-level)\n\nThe language of the code (ES2022).\nIndependent of the module format.\n\n### [Entry point](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/angular-package-format\\#entry-point)\n\nA module intended to be imported by the user.\nIt is referenced by a unique module ID and exports the public API referenced by that module ID.\nAn example is `@angular/core` or `@angular/core/testing`.\nBoth entry points exist in the `@angular/core` package, but they export different symbols.\nA package can have many entry points.\n\n### [Deep import](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/angular-package-format\\#deep-import)\n\nA process of retrieving symbols from modules that are not Entry Points.\nThese module IDs are usually considered to be private APIs that can change over the lifetime of the project or while the bundle for the given package is being created.\n\n### [Top-Level import](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/angular-package-format\\#top-level-import)\n\nAn import coming from an entry point.\nThe available top-level imports are what define the public API and are exposed in \"@angular/name\" modules, such as `@angular/core` or `@angular/common`.\n\n### [Tree-shaking](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/angular-package-format\\#tree-shaking)\n\nThe process of identifying and removing code not used by an application - also known as dead code elimination.\nThis is a global optimization performed at the application level using tools like [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/), [Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler), or [Terser](https://github.com/terser/terser).\n\n### [AOT compiler](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/angular-package-format\\#aot-compiler)\n\nThe Ahead of Time Compiler for Angular.\n\n### [Flattened type definitions](https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/angular-package-format\\#flattened-type-definitions)\n\nThe bundled TypeScript definitions generated from [API Extractor](https://api-extractor.com/).",
