This section details the optional features and their usages.\n\n### [`withFetch`](https://angular.dev/guide/http/setup\\#withfetch)\n\n```\n      export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {  providers: [    provideHttpClient(      withFetch(),    ),  ]};\n\n```\n\ncheck\n\nBy default, `HttpClient` uses the [`XMLHttpRequest`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) API to make requests. The `withFetch` feature switches the client to use the [`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) API instead.\n\n`fetch` is a more modern API and is available in a few environments where `XMLHttpRequest` is not supported. It does have a few limitations, such as not producing upload progress events.\n\n### [`withInterceptors(...)`](https://angular.dev/guide/http/setup\\#withinterceptors)\n\n`withInterceptors` configures the set of interceptor functions which will process requests made through `HttpClient`. See the [interceptor guide](https://angular.dev/guide/http/guide/http/interceptors) for more information.\n\n### [`withInterceptorsFromDi()`](https://angular.dev/guide/http/setup\\#withinterceptorsfromdi)\n\n`withInterceptorsFromDi` includes the older style of class-based interceptors in the `HttpClient` configuration. See the [interceptor guide](https://angular.dev/guide/http/guide/http/interceptors) for more information.\n\n**HELPFUL:** Functional interceptors (through `withInterceptors`) have more predictable ordering and we recommend them over DI-based interceptors.\n\n### [`withRequestsMadeViaParent()`](https://angular.dev/guide/http/setup\\#withrequestsmadeviaparent)\n\nBy default, when you configure `HttpClient` using `provideHttpClient` within a given injector, this configuration overrides any configuration for `HttpClient` which may be present in the parent injector.\n\nWhen you add `withRequestsMadeViaParent()`, `HttpClient` is configured to instead pass requests up to the `HttpClient` instance in the parent injector, once they've passed through any configured interceptors at this level. This is useful if you want to _add_ interceptors in a child injector, while still sending the request through the parent injector's interceptors as well.\n\n**CRITICAL:** You must configure an instance of `HttpClient` above the current injector, or this option is not valid and you'll get a runtime error when you try to use it.\n\n### [`withJsonpSupport()`](https://angular.dev/guide/http/setup\\#withjsonpsupport)\n\nIncluding `withJsonpSupport` enables the `.jsonp()` method on `HttpClient`, which makes a GET request via the [JSONP convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP) for cross-domain loading of data.\n\n**HELPFUL:** Prefer using [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) to make cross-domain requests instead of JSONP when possible.\n\n### [`withXsrfConfiguration(...)`](https://angular.dev/guide/http/setup\\#withxsrfconfiguration)\n\nIncluding this option allows for customization of `HttpClient`'s built-in XSRF security functionality. See the [security guide](https://angular.dev/guide/http/best-practices/security) for more information.\n\n### [`withNoXsrfProtection()`](https://angular.dev/guide/http/setup\\#withnoxsrfprotection)\n\nIncluding this option disables `HttpClient`'s built-in XSRF security functionality. See the [security guide](https://angular.dev/guide/http/best-practices/security) for more information.\n\n## [`HttpClientModule`-based configuration](https://angular.dev/guide/http/setup\\#httpclientmodule-based-configuration)\n\nSome applications may configure `HttpClient` using the older API based on NgModules.\n\nThis table lists the NgModules available from `@angular/common/http` and how they relate to the provider configuration functions above.\n\n| **NgModule** | `provideHttpClient()` equivalent |\n| --- | --- |\n| `HttpClientModule` | `provideHttpClient(withInterceptorsFromDi())` |\n| `HttpClientJsonpModule` | `withJsonpSupport()` |\n| `HttpClientXsrfModule.withOptions(...)` | `withXsrfConfiguration(...)` |\n| `HttpClientXsrfModule.disable()` | `withNoXsrfProtection()` |\n\n### Use caution when using HttpClientModule in multiple injectors\n\nWhen `HttpClientModule` is present in multiple injectors, the behavior of interceptors is poorly defined and depends on the exact options and provider/import ordering.\n\nPrefer `provideHttpClient` for multi-injector configurations, as it has more stable behavior. See the `withRequestsMadeViaParent` feature above.",
