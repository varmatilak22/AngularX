Now go ahead and implement this along with the `UserComponent` in the playground.\n\nUse `'user'` for the path of `UserComponent`.\n\n2. ### [Add title to route definition](https://angular.dev/tutorials/learn-angular/13-define-a-route\\#add-title-to-route-definition)\n\n\nIn addition to defining the routes correctly, Angular Router also enables you to set the page title whenever users are navigating by adding the `title` property to each route.\n\nIn `app.routes.ts`, add the `title` property to the default route ( `path: ''`) and the `user` route. Here's an example:\n\n\n\n```\n         import {Routes} from '@angular/router';import {HomeComponent} from './home/home.component';export const routes: Routes = [{path: '',title: 'App Home Page',component: HomeComponent,},];\n\n```\n\ncheck\n\n\nIn the activity, you've learned how to define and configure routes in your Angular app. Nice work. ðŸ™Œ\n\nThe journey to fully enabling routing in your app is almost complete, keep going.\n\napp/app.routes.ts editdelete\n\napp/home/home.component.ts\n\nadd\n\nlaunchdownload\n\n9\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nâ€º\n\nimport{Routes}from'@angular/router';\n\nimport{HomeComponent}from'./home/home.component';\n\nimport{UserComponent}from'./user/user.component';\n\nexportconstroutes:Routes=\\[\\];\n\nPreview\n\nBooting\n\nConsole\n\nTerminal\n\nrefresh",
